# one-generic-website

Mainly for basic blogging.

Things I want to do with this:

  - [x] Rename the "starter-app" project to "StarterApp"  
        (And update all the namespaces from starter_app to StarterApp)
  - [x] Add identity framework, customize it just enough to let me log in, and 
        add just enough authorization so that I'm the only one who can edit
        things
  - [ ] Deploy
  - [ ] Separate the parts into a clean (or "onion") architecture
  - [ ] Add blog records to CRUD
  - [ ] Add markdown parsing
  - Add support for multiple DB back-ends:
      - [ ] SQL Server
      - [ ] Oracle
      - [ ] Postgres
      - [ ] MySQL
  - [ ] Add image support
  - [ ] Add a way for user to switch to a dark theme
